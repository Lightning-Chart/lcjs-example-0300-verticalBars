This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

_Also known as Bar Graph, Column Chart or Column Graph_

This example shows the most basic usage of LightningChart JS `BarChart`.
Bar Charts show discrete numerical comparisons across categories, where the value represents the height of a bar.
LightningChart JS includes a very simple high level feature for creating interactive Bar Charts and supplying them with categorical data:

```ts
const barChart = lightningChart().BarChart()
const data = [
    { category: 'Jan', value: 20 },
    { category: 'Feb', value: 20 },
    { category: 'Mar', value: -25 },
    { category: 'Apr', value: 40 },
    { category: 'May', value: 28 },
    { category: 'Jun', value: -23 },
    { category: 'Jul', value: -40 },
    { category: 'Aug', value: 35 },
    { category: 'Sep', value: 17 },
    { category: 'Oct', value: 24 },
    { category: 'Nov', value: -29 },
    { category: 'Dec', value: 15 },
]
barChart.setData(data)
```
